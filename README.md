# movies_admin
Movie Admin is a prototype asp.net core MVC project to understand the clean architecture, domain driven design and seperation of concerns.
This project is built on asp.net, .net core 5.0, entity framework, MediatR, Automapper, and Sqlite.

The idea of project is used to provide an example of clean architecture by following the Domain driven design (DDD). The solution is divided in to projects like Domain (contains entities, value objects and domain events),
Application Core (contains the business logic), Persistance (contains the entity framework) and frontend (contains the razor)

Note: Project intention is for clean architecture,DDD, so UI is not great.
